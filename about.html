				    Just not long ago, when I needed to write an artist bio, I scratched my head and came up with the following.
				  </p>
				  <p>
				  <i>
				  <p> Florence is a Melbourne based artist whose main art practice is in painting and drawing with 
traditional medium. Besides art, she is also an IT professional with a background in Data Science. 
Below is her first-person bio:</p>
<p>"I have been painting and drawing almost ever since I was born. Painting and art to me is something 
personal and extremely special in life. Academically, I have considered myself to be fortunate. In 
2014, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sydney studying the intricacies of 
visual similarity that lies among different types of art imageries. I then continued my journey in 
science by working at CSIRO for another five years. </p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, I was fortunate to have a small career change, hence had found myself start 
pursuing something I always had passion in. Beyond the visual qualities, I am a believer in arts with 
great emotional and psychological depth and their story telling power to the intended audience. And 
I hope to carry that belief into my day-to-day art practice."</p> </i>
				  
				  </p>
				  <br>
				 
				  <p> I came to the conclusion <b>"The definition does not matter !"</b>. If you are interested in my art or work in data science, please <a href="contact.html" style="color:red">get in touch</a> !
