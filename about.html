				    Just not long ago, when I needed to write an artist bio, I scratched my head and came up with the following.
				  </p>
				  <p ><i>
				    Melbourne based, Florence, started her pursuit in art originally in her teen age years. Although later formally trained with a PhD in computer science, her passion and love for art has never died. By day, she applies the aesthetics and principles gained from art to the field of data analytics and information technology.  While in her spare time, she uses art particularly in the form of drawings and paintings as a medium to document the journey of her inner creativities and emotional expressions. Standing on the edges of art, technology and science, her approaches to art bring the unique combination of her childhood artistic pursuit, and the understanding and interpretation of both logical and emotional worlds.
				  </i></p>
                  <br>
				  <p> I came to the conclusion <b>"The definition does not matter !"</b>. If you are interested in my art or work in data science, please <a href="contact.html" style="color:red">get in touch</a> !
